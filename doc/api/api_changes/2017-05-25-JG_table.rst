Improvements to tables
----------------------

Text alignment within cells now uses `center_baseline` for vertical
alignment, than `center`.  This looks better, with the text no
longer hugging the top of the cells.

Internal logic improved to improve auto-sizing of fonts.

`table` function now allows control of the cell edge colours with the
addition of `cellEdgeColours`, `rowEdgeColours`, `colEdgeColours` and
`edgeColour` keywords.   Default values are `None` which preserves the
previous behaviour of black edges to cells.
